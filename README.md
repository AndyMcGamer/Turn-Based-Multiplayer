# Turn-Based-Multiplayer
Turn Based Multiplayer

Multiplayer Lobby System using LiteNetLib RUDP Library
- Peer-to-Peer connection
- Mimick Client-Server Architecture
  - This is done by the host client running a separate headless "server" that all clients connect to (including the host)
  - This decision to mimick client-server connections was made to increase security slightly and create the opportunity for server validation

Supports:
- Fully functioning lobby system
- Hosting a Peer-to-Peer lobby
- Other Users Joining/Leaving
  - Lobby list reflecting realtime changes
